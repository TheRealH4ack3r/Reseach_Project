# Reseach_Project_Python

Hey viewer...
This program was developed to help schools determine who needs to quarentine post infection.
The user creates a classroom where they will specify the names of students and which student is infected.
The user will recieve a prompt after entering all values asking if they would like to scan the class (mark students for quarentine).

PS: To run the executable you will need to go into the dist folder and select the "start" application.
The file is NOT A VIRUS, however you will need to click "run anyway" after opening the application becuase the windows firewall veiws unknown executable files as potential threats.
